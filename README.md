# reeve-connectors

Connectors: Composio toolkits and MCP servers the broker acts through, plus CSV and app record readers.

Package `@reeve/connectors`. The broker calls tools only through this registry: Composio's 1,500+ toolkits
(`COMPOSIO_API_KEY`), any MCP server listed in `REEVE_MCP_SERVERS`, or a log-only connector when nothing
is set up. It also reads records from CSV files and connected apps, and checks at build time that every
tool a rulebook names is available.

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

## Working across repos

Shared packages are installed straight from GitHub (`"@reeve/core": "github:Reeve-Agents/reeve-core#main"`) and pinned by
`package-lock.json`. After a change lands in one of them, pull it in with:

```bash
npm update @reeve/core
```

To edit two repos side by side, clone them next to each other and link the local copy:

```bash
npm install ../reeve-core --no-save
```
